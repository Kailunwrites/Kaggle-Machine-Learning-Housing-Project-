Notes: 
- Response variable: maybe do BoxCox to see if normality better than log-trans

- Continuous Variables:
	- Remove outliers
		- LotFrontage
		- LotArea
		- MasVnrArea
		- BsmtFinSF1
		- TotalBsmnSF
		- 1stFlrSF
		- 2ndFlrSF
		- GrLivArea
	- Remove variables
		- BsmtFinSF2
		- LowQualFinSF
		- MiscVal
		- GarageYrBlt

- Discreet Numerical Variables:
	- Remove variables
		- MoSold
		- OverallCond (remove, OverallQual higher correlation)
		- BedroomAbvGr (totalrooms higher correlation)
		- KitchenAbvGr
		- Fireplaces (creating binary)
		- PoolArea
		- MoSold
		- YrSold (calculate age instead)
		- GarageCars (turn into categorical)

- Categorical Variables:
	- Notes
		- Fence = NA means no fence (impute when dummifying)
		- Alley = NA means no alley access (impute when dummifying)
	- Remove

- Feature Engineering:

	Jon to-do
	- Total Area = GrLivArea + TotalBsmSF  
	- Total Finished Area = GrLivArea + Finished Basement area   
	- Has2ndFl = has second floor (0 and 1)
	- Age_Built = YrSold - YearBuilt
	- Age_remod = YrSold - YearRemodAdd
	- TotalPorchSF =  OpenPorchSF + EnclosedSF + 3SsnPorch + ScreenPorch
	- HasDeck = 0 (no), 1 (yes)
	- HasPorch = 0 (no), 1 (yes)
	- TotBaths = Fullbath + 0.5*Halfbath (both in house and basement)
	- HasFirePlace = 0 (no), 1 (not-Ex), 2 (Ex)
	- GarageCars = 0, 1, 2, 3+ categorical
	- HasPool?

some helpful code: HasDeck and HasPorch
#create column for new variable (one is enough because it's a binary categorical feature)
#if area>0 it gets 1, for area==0 it gets 0

df_train['HasDeck'] = pd.Series(len(df_train['WoodDeckSF']), index=df_train.index)
df_train['HasDeck'] = 0 
df_train.loc[df_train['WoodDeckSF']>0,'HasDeck'] = 1

Total area skewness: cone shape in scatter plot? Need equal levels of variance across the range of Total Area:
#data transformation
df_train['Total_Area'] = np.log(df_train['Total_Area'])
